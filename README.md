# Snake Game Tutorial

A simple snake game built using Python and the Pygame library. This game provides an introduction to creating a basic game loop, handling user inputs, and implementing game states like pause and game over.

## Features
- Basic movement and controls for the snake.
- Collision detection with borders and apples.
- Scorekeeping based on apple consumption.
- Pausing and resuming the game.
- Game over with the option to restart or quit.

## Installation

1. Install [Python](https://www.python.org/) (if you haven't already).
2. Install the Pygame library using pip:

    ```bash
    pip install pygame
    ```

3. Clone or download the repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/snake-game-tutorial.git
    cd snake-game-tutorial
    ```

4. Place the `apple.png` and `snake_head.png` images in the same directory as the script.

## How to Play

1. Run the script using Python:

    ```bash
    python snake_game.py
    ```

2. The game will start with an intro screen.
   - Press `C` to start the game.
   - Press `Q` to quit.

3. During the game:
   - Use the arrow keys to control the snake's movement.
   - Press `P` to pause the game.

4. The game ends when the snake collides with itself or the screen borders. You can restart by pressing `C` or quit by pressing `Q`.
